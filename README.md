# Landmarks AR

The Visit AR team presents **Landsmarks AR**, an innovative and modern way to experience history and culture in your city using AR technologies.

## How does it work?

After installing the app, you can scan QR codes on various landmarks around your city. Each code contains a reenactment of the scene related to the scanned landmark, made using high-quality 3D scanned models. Additionally, you will be accompanied by a virtual tour guide and info boxes around each relevant object.

You can also optionally explore each landmark scene in the "Library" section of the app, without needing to scan a QR code first.

## How is it made?

The AR visualizing and QR code scanning portions, as well as the entire mobile UI, are made in Unreal Engine 5. This ensures a future-proof and high quality platform for virtual experiences.

An accompanying info website containing a download link and a support form is made in React.js, and a supplementary backend for critical services is made using Laravel.
